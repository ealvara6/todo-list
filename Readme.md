I created a simple to-do website application that allows users to store tasks into their own personal projects. these tasks and projects are locally stored and do not get removed on page reload. I incorporated many techniques that I learned from previous Odin Project lessons and have learned mistakes that I have made in this project that I will be sure to try and avoid in my future projects.
